{"id":"mala-0k7","title":"Close epics after each agent completion, not just at run end","description":"## Problem\n\nCurrently, epics are only checked for closure at the end of a run. If an agent completes the last child issue of an epic mid-run, the epic stays open until the entire run finishes.\n\nThis means:\n- Epic status doesn't reflect reality during the run\n- Other agents may not see updated epic status for dependency resolution\n- `bd ready` may return stale results if epic completion affects other issues\n\n## Desired Behavior\n\nAfter each agent successfully completes an issue:\n1. Check if the issue belongs to any epics (via parent-child dependency)\n2. For each parent epic, check if all children are now closed\n3. If all children closed, close the epic with reason \"All children completed\"\n\n## Implementation\n\nIn `src/orchestrator.py`, after closing an issue in the agent completion flow:\n\n```python\n# After: bd close \u003cissue_id\u003e\n# Add: Check and close parent epics if all children done\nawait self._close_completed_epics(issue_id)\n```\n\nThe `_close_completed_epics` method should:\n1. Get parent epic(s) for the issue via `bd show \u003cissue_id\u003e --json`\n2. For each parent, check if all children are closed via `bd epic children \u003cepic_id\u003e --json`\n3. If all closed, run `bd close \u003cepic_id\u003e --reason \"All children completed\"`\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Epics close immediately when last child completes\n- [ ] Works for nested epics (closing child epic triggers parent check)\n- [ ] Logged when epic is auto-closed\n- [ ] Tests verify epic closure after child completion\n\n## Files\n- src/orchestrator.py\n- tests/test_orchestrator.py","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-27T06:38:21.964459481Z","updated_at":"2025-12-27T06:38:21.964459481Z"}

This is the **only** issue that should edit `src/main.py` and tests.\n\n### Files\n- Add: `src/cli.py`\n- Modify: `src/main.py`\n- Modify: `tests/test_lock_integration.py`\n- Modify: `tests/test_lock_sdk_integration.py`\n- Modify: any files needed to update imports/paths after the prompt move\n\n## Requirements\n- Create `src/cli.py` with the Typer app + commands currently defined in `src/main.py`.\n- Move CLI-adjacent logic out of `src/main.py` so it becomes a tiny shim that only exposes `app`.\n- Update imports to use the new modules:\n  - `src/tools/env.py`\n  - `src/logging/console.py`\n  - `src/logging/jsonl.py`\n  - `src/agent_loop.py`\n  - `src/tools/locking.py`\n- Update prompt loading to the new path: `src/prompts/implementer_prompt.md`.\n- Update tests to import from new module paths (locking + prompt template).\n- Keep `pyproject.toml` entrypoint as `src.main:app`.\n\n## TDD Guidance\n- Update tests first (imports/paths), run relevant tests:\n  - `tests/test_lock_integration.py`\n  - `tests/test_lock_sdk_integration.py`\n  - `tests/test_lock_scripts.py`\n- Then implement wiring changes and re-run the tests.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- `src/main.py` is a thin shim (import + expose `app`).\n- CLI behavior is unchanged (`mala --help` identical).\n- Prompt loads from the new location.\n- Locking + prompt tests pass with updated imports.\n- All refactor modules are used by the CLI/orchestrator.\n","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-25T19:54:51.18845258Z","updated_at":"2025-12-25T20:24:59.79953084Z","closed_at":"2025-12-25T20:24:59.79953084Z","close_reason":"Closed","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"mala-rsq","depends_on_id":"mala-9ki","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-25T20:06:47.478081301Z","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"mala-rsq","depends_on_id":"mala-1by","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-25T20:06:47.48915539Z","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"mala-rsq","depends_on_id":"mala-lm0","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-25T20:06:47.499510627Z","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"mala-rsq","depends_on_id":"mala-wd1","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-25T20:06:47.510195051Z","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"mala-rsq","depends_on_id":"mala-5aa","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-25T20:06:47.520878684Z","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"mala-rsq","depends_on_id":"mala-vrm","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-25T20:06:47.530900735Z","created_by":"daemon"}]}

{"id":"mala-ytn","title":"Make tooling language/package-manager agnostic","description":"## Context\nCurrently the codebase is tightly coupled to Python + uv + ruff + ty. Validation commands, quality gate parsing, and prompts all assume this specific toolchain.\n\n## Goal\nMake mala usable with other language/toolchain combinations (e.g., TypeScript/npm, Rust/cargo, Go, etc.) by abstracting the toolchain layer.\n\n## Areas Affected\n\n### Validation Commands (src/validation/)\n- Hardcoded commands: `uv sync`, `uv run pytest`, `uvx ruff check`, `uvx ruff format`, `uvx ty check`\n- Need to support equivalent commands for other ecosystems (npm install, npm test, eslint, tsc, etc.)\n\n### Quality Gate Parsing (src/quality_gate.py)\n- Parses output patterns specific to pytest, ruff, ty\n- Needs configurable or pluggable pattern matching\n\n### Prompts (src/prompts/implementer_prompt.md)\n- References specific tools and commands\n- Should be templated or configurable per project\n\n### CLAUDE.md\n- Project-specific instructions currently assumed to follow Python conventions\n- Should be the source of truth for project toolchain\n\n## Approach Options\n\n1. **Config-driven**: Define toolchain in pyproject.toml/mala.toml with command mappings\n2. **Auto-detect**: Detect toolchain from project files (package.json, Cargo.toml, go.mod, etc.)\n3. **Plugin system**: Allow custom validation plugins per language\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- mala can run on a TypeScript project with npm/eslint/tsc\n- Toolchain commands are configurable, not hardcoded\n- Quality gate can parse outputs from multiple test/lint frameworks\n- Documentation covers how to configure for different languages\n\n## Out of Scope (for now)\n- IDE integration changes\n- Language-specific code generation\n- Multi-language monorepos","status":"blocked","priority":3,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-26T23:35:50.333488526Z","updated_at":"2025-12-27T00:54:58.183405109Z"}
