{"id":"mala-rsq","title":"Refactor: split CLI into cli.py and make main.py a shim","description":"## Context\nWe will parallelize by creating new modules in separate issues, then do a single integration pass to wire everything together. This issue is the integration/wiring step.\n\n## Scope\nWire all refactor modules into the app, update tests, and make `src/main.py` a true shim. This is the **only** issue that should edit `src/main.py` and tests.\n\n### Files\n- Add: `src/cli.py`\n- Modify: `src/main.py`\n- Modify: `tests/test_lock_integration.py`\n- Modify: `tests/test_lock_sdk_integration.py`\n- Modify: any files needed to update imports/paths after the prompt move\n\n## Requirements\n- Create `src/cli.py` with the Typer app + commands currently defined in `src/main.py`.\n- Move CLI-adjacent logic out of `src/main.py` so it becomes a tiny shim that only exposes `app`.\n- Update imports to use the new modules:\n  - `src/tools/env.py`\n  - `src/logging/console.py`\n  - `src/logging/jsonl.py`\n  - `src/agent_loop.py`\n  - `src/tools/locking.py`\n- Update prompt loading to the new path: `src/prompts/implementer_prompt.md`.\n- Update tests to import from new module paths (locking + prompt template).\n- Keep `pyproject.toml` entrypoint as `src.main:app`.\n\n## TDD Guidance\n- Update tests first (imports/paths), run relevant tests:\n  - `tests/test_lock_integration.py`\n  - `tests/test_lock_sdk_integration.py`\n  - `tests/test_lock_scripts.py`\n- Then implement wiring changes and re-run the tests.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- `src/main.py` is a thin shim (import + expose `app`).\n- CLI behavior is unchanged (`mala --help` identical).\n- Prompt loads from the new location.\n- Locking + prompt tests pass with updated imports.\n- All refactor modules are used by the CLI/orchestrator.\n","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-25T19:54:51.18845258Z","updated_at":"2025-12-25T20:24:59.79953084Z","closed_at":"2025-12-25T20:24:59.79953084Z","close_reason":"Closed","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"mala-rsq","depends_on_id":"mala-9ki","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-25T20:06:47.478081301Z","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"mala-rsq","depends_on_id":"mala-1by","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-25T20:06:47.48915539Z","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"mala-rsq","depends_on_id":"mala-lm0","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-25T20:06:47.499510627Z","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"mala-rsq","depends_on_id":"mala-wd1","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-25T20:06:47.510195051Z","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"mala-rsq","depends_on_id":"mala-5aa","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-25T20:06:47.520878684Z","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"mala-rsq","depends_on_id":"mala-vrm","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-25T20:06:47.530900735Z","created_by":"daemon"}]}
